# Mapuche
Tool for creating 2D RPG binary maps.

It uses PyQt5 and Python 3.x.  
Also you should run:
    pip install opencv-python

We use the version 3.3.0.9.

I'm following the PEP8 but if you use the 'pycodestylemodule' it might show you that I'm not taking in count a rule.  
A reason is: If I did it in the way the program want me to do it, I would break the rule of the 72 characters, which is
personally one of the most usefuls since I work with a splited terminal.
